Problem 1:

When the velocity is negative, I push the cart left. When the velocity is positive or 0, I push the cart right. This means that the cart is always being pushed in the direction of its velocity. That allows it to get maximum speed/momentum as quickly as possible, allowing it to go over the hill and reach the flag.
